# Volunteer Request Approval System (FoMD)

This repository contains the source code for a Google Apps Script-based workflow used by the Faculty of Medicine & Dentistry (FoMD) to manage volunteer request approvals. The system handles form submissions, sequential multi-role approvals (Chair, HR, and Office of Research), PDF generation, and automated email notifications.

## üìÑ Script Files

### `onApprovalFormSubmit(e)`
Triggered on form submission. Handles logic based on which sheet the form data came from:

- **Initial Form (Source):** assigns UUID, sends Chair request
- **Chair Form:** logs decision, updates status, triggers HR email
- **HR Form:** logs decision, updates status, triggers OoR email
- **OoR Form:** logs decision, updates status, sends final approval PDF

### `send[Role]ApprovalEmail(...)`
Sends emails to each role with prefilled approval links and summary.

### `sendFinalApprovalEmail(...)`
Sends completed PDF with approvals to all involved emails (Chair, HR, OoR, Requester).

### `sendRejectionEmail(...)`
Handles formatting and dispatch of rejection notification email.

### `createFinalPDF(...)`
- Pulls form data and approval metadata
- Builds structured PDF using `DocumentApp`
- Includes clickable waiver/background links

### `getApproverByColumn(...)`
- Retrieves name of approver by Unique ID and column index.

### `getApprovalDateByColumn(...)`

## üñ•Ô∏è Web Interface (HTML Page)

Provides a basic UI to list submissions and allow manual approval/denial:

```html
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Department</th>
    <th>Waiver</th>
    <th>Background Check</th>
    <th>Approve/Deny</th>
  </tr>
</table>
```
Buttons call server-side `approveRequest(id)` or `denyRequest(id)` methods.

---

## üïí Timestamp Sync Helper

```js
function copyNewTimestampWithUniqueID() {
  // Copies the timestamp + default 'Chair' status to Status sheet
}
```
Used to sync data rows with status tracking on initial form submission.

---

## üì¶ Notes & Caveats

- Files in "Shared with Me" (e.g., uploaded waiver/background docs) **do not count** against your Drive quota unless you copy or move them.
- Ensure column indices (e.g., approval decision in column G for HR) match the form structure.
- HR Name in the final PDF pulls from column index `3` in `hrSheet` to correct display issues.

---

## üîê Access and Permissions
- Make sure all forms and Drive folders used for uploading documents are shared appropriately.
- Approvers must be logged into their UAlberta accounts to access prefilled approval forms.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Next Steps (Future Improvements)
- Add signature capture
- Add retry logic for email failures
- Add a submission dashboard with status filters
- Improve PDF formatting/styling
