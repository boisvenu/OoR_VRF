# Volunteer Approval System for FoMD

This Google Apps Script-based system automates multi-stage approvals for volunteer onboarding in the Faculty of Medicine & Dentistry (FoMD). It collects information through a Google Form, manages approvals through three sequential approvers, and generates a final PDF once all approvals are complete.

## üîÑ Workflow Overview

1. **Initial Form Submission**: The original requester submits a form.
2. **Chair Approval**: The department chair receives a pre-filled form and reviews the request.
3. **HR Approval**: If approved by the chair, the HR partner is emailed with a pre-filled form for approval.
4. **Office of Research Approval (OoR)**: Final review and approval by the Office of Research.
5. **PDF Generation**: A final summary PDF is created and distributed to all stakeholders.
6. **Status Tracking**: Each stage is tracked in a dedicated Google Sheet tab.
